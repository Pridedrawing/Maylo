      "title": "The story behind the release",
      "description": "We got Maylo as an adult dog. He originally came from Poland, had already been adopted once in Germany, and was returned to the shelter because he bit. He would snap if a hand approached too quickly. But this was simply because he thought he was being hit. With a lot of patience and calm, we were able to overcome his fear. Within a very short time, he completely changed his behavior, regained his trust, and became an absolute model student.\n\nThere was also a serious dog bite incident at the shelter where he was almost killed by a Doberman. The animal welfare organization invested a lot of money to save him. Consequently, he was initially afraid of large dogs in particular. After many positive encounters, this fear completely disappeared.\n\nHe was only with us for 2.5 years before the cancer diagnosis, but in that time, he etched himself into our hearts forever. It started with a slight limp, which later turned out to be bone marrow cancer. It wasn't even two months before we had to let him go. These songs describe the emotional journey we went through during this difficult time."
